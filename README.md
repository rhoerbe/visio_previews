# export PNG images from all Visio files in a given directory

Set input and output path and exclusions in config.yaml


## Issues
- close all Visio documents before starting the script
- Some Viso documents  may require manual closing, click "do not save" (caused by multiple tabs?) 
- Previews are canvas sized, not the selection of all shapes -> may be lots of whitespace
